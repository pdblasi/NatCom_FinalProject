\chapter{Solution}

\section{Phase 1 - Design Approach}
	% Talk about initial design of game system/rules
	% Mention client/server architecture, and decisions to develop
	%  server from algorithm to network, and
	%  client from GUI to algorithm to network.

\section{Phase 2 - Prototype $\alpha$}
	% Talk about initial steps taken in design.
	% Server was a mish-mash of code to get a running ``CA''
	% Client was a sandbox GUI to figure out program structuring approach

\section{Phase 2 - Prototype $\beta$}
	% Talk about next steps taken in design.
	% Server was modularized and broken down into classes
	% Client solified MVC pattern and developed algorithms

\section{Phase 3 - Networking Structure}
	% Discuss networking structure (agreed-upon transmission protocol)

\section{Phase 4 - Networking Architecture}
	% Discuss networking creation
	% Server created two classes, one to handle low-level communication and the other to manage connections
	% Client created...(I'm not sure. Paul: you'll have to field this one)

\section{Phase 5 - Testing and Review}
	% Not here quite yet.
